## About Me

I am a second year IASC student. I am hoping that this educational path will allow me to pursue a multitude of careers related to the digital humanities, specifically in game design as well as possibly animation or 3D modelling. Although I had initially applied for the Game Design program at Brock, I opted to take IASC instead as I feel the broader topics allow the students to choose their own specific ways to navigate the program. My specific specialization of interest in the digital humanities is digital archaeology. The reason for this is I take a special interest in looking back on past technologies and how they pushed innovation in the technology sector, as innovation is the foundation of digital humanities. My interest in this specialization is seen through the solo presentation I gave this year on the Nokia N-Gage. Hopefully in the future, my interest in digital archaeology will allow me to foresee changes in the technology sector (and games industry) and be able to adapt to them. This awareness will in turn allow me to become an asset in digital humanities professions. I can then have a variety of options in career paths related to my choices in education.

## Featured Project: Nokia N-Gage Solo Presentation

The project that I chose to feature in my portfolio is the solo presentation I gave on the outdated technology called the Nokia N-Gage. For this project, we were tasked with creating a slideshow presentation in the Pecha Kucha format, where each slide could take only twenty seconds apiece. This time constriction forces the presenter to give only the most valuable information in a very concise manner. I have chosen this presentation as my featured project due to the purpose of the presentation, which was to look at and present on content related to media archaeology. As I stated in my bio, I am very interested in the history of technology and how it affects the development and innovation of newer technologies. I believe that this presentation touches on some important aspects of media archaeology, using past and present analysis and some look into the future of similar technologies and how companies may look at the development of innovative technologies or at the very least improvements on those that exist now. I also consider the reasons why the piece of technology was not able to succeed, and how the aspects of the consumer culture could not allow the technology in question to flourish as a consumer product. The presentation gives us as students the opportunity to start thinking about media archaeology and its impact on the technology sector.


While revising my project, I looked at the rubric I received as an assessment for the quality of my presentation. The feedback received was very constructive as it pointed out some flaws in my presentation that I completely overlooked. The first was that in my presentation, I did not speak about how our relationship with technology has changed or been altered due to the Nokia N-Gage. To fix this, I made sure to touch on the reception of the technology and how it has affected the habits of consumers when considering the purchase of modern technology, thus speaking on the change in our relationship with tech such as the N-Gage. The feedback I received also pointed out I did not touch on the conditions for the N-Gage’s failure enough. This was easily fixed by providing examples of the market that the technology was trying to appeal to, and how it failed in doing this, leading to its increasing irrelevance. Overall, the feedback I was provided with allowed me to create a more complete product, that adhered better to the project’s initial guidelines. While the changes I made cannot be seen through commits in the GitHub repository, they can be seen in the addition of more slides with accompanying speakers notes in the slideshow itself.

## Collaborative Project

For this project, our class was split into groups who were tasked with presenting on a variety of Digital Humanities tools. The presentation contained an introduction to the tool, its features, an example of a product made by the tool, and a theoretical discussion on how the tool relates to digital scholarship ideas we had previously discussed. For this we created a slideshow that we then situated in GitHub. Our chosen topic was called Hypercities. This tool allowed the use of text analysis to create historical maps based on the content of the text. Because of the complexity of the tool, we were not able to create a product with the tool, but instead focused on analyzing the works of other who could.
