## About Me

I am a second year IASC student. I am hoping that this educational path will allow me to pursue a multitude of careers, specifically in game design as well as possibly animation or 3D modelling. Although I had initially applied for the Game Design program at Brock, I opted to take IASC as I feel the more broad topics allow the students to choose their own specific ways to navigate the program.
