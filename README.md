## About Me

I am a second year IASC student. I am hoping that this educational path will allow me to pursue a multitude of careers related to the digital humanities, specifically in game design as well as possibly animation or 3D modelling. Although I had initially applied for the Game Design program at Brock, I opted to take IASC instead as I feel the broader topics allow the students to choose their own specific ways to navigate the program. My specific specialization of interest in the digital humanities is digital archaeology. The reason for this is I take a special interest in looking back on past technologies and how they pushed innovation in the technology sector, as innovation is the foundation of digital humanities. My interest in this specialization is seen through the solo presentation I gave this year on the Nokia N-Gage. Hopefully in the future, my interest in digital archaeology will allow me to foresee changes in the technology sector (and games industry) and be able to adapt to them. This awareness will in turn allow me to become an asset in digital humanities professions. I can then have a variety of options in career paths related to my choices in education.
